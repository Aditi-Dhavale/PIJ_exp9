repository for java lab assignment 9

This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating the usage of threads. The code consists of two classes: Main and MyThread.

Main Class
The Main class serves as the entry point of the program. It demonstrates the basic operations on a thread such as starting, renaming, checking its status, making it sleep, and joining.

Usage
To execute the program, compile and run the Main class.

MyThread Class
The MyThread class extends the Thread class and overrides its run method. This method defines the behavior of the thread when it is executed.

Usage
You can use the MyThread class to define custom behavior for a thread.
